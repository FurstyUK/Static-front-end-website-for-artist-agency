## Credit for external Source's that I used

* Source material how to implement the above technolgies from CodeInstitute Web development course.
* ![https://placehold.co] to make the placeholder imgaes look cleaner and iformative of the size of image the user would need to us.
* De-bugging code errors i couldnt understandand from my Farther who is a software engineer.
* Stream deck. I set up multiple keybinds to write quicker and easier, each base ie. <a> would have the basic code needed allowing me to put the fill code in once ive pressed the according button on my deck.
* I used ![jsdelivr.net] for boostrapping.
* For Validating i used W3C and Jigsaw.
## Testing

I used 2 ways of testing, on visual studio code i enabled 2 extensions to test. 
 - Live server ritwickdey.LiveServer
 - CelianRiboulet.webvalidator

Live server was used throughout writing the code. Using it to check up on any major changes to make sure they looked and worked right.
Validator was used at the end of writing.
