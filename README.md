## Testing

I used 2 ways of testing, on visual studio code i enabled 2 extensions to test. 
 - Live server ritwickdey.LiveServer
 - CelianRiboulet.webvalidator

Live server was used throughout writing the code. Using it to check up on any major changes to make sure they looked and worked right.
Validator was used at the end of writing.
