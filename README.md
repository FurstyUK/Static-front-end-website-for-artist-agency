External Source's that I used:

* ![https://placehold.co] to make the placeholder imgaes look cleaner and iformative of the size of image the user would need to us.
* De-bugging code errors i couldnt understandand from my Farther who is a software engineer.
* Stream deck. I set up multiple keybinds to write quicker and easier, each base ie. <a> would have the basic code needed allowing me to put the fill code in once ive pressed the according button on my deck.
* I used ![jsdelivr.net] for boostrapping.
